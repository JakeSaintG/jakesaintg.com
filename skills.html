                <p>Since 2016 I have been a Registered Nurse working in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. During this time I have gained additional training and acquired
                    certifications in Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) as well as training in PRISMA (Continuous Dialysis). I helped managed life support equipment
                    and worked with multidisciplinary teammates deliver compassionate care. I would respond to rapid changes in patient condition and worked well under pressure.
                    During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I transitioned to an Adult ICU to aid with the increasing numbers of critical patients.

                <p>I recently decided to work on transitioning to software and web development as a career. Through Code Louisville and Treehouse,
                    I have gained knowledge and experience in Front End Web Development. I intend to always be learning by soaking up as much knowledge
                    as my classes and mentors are able to share. I am still working to be the best developer that I can and hope to break into the tech industry soon! Stay tuned!

                <p>It’s a hobby! I started this as a stress relief in college and utilized it for event posters on campus as well as a couple of
                    video projects for school. Click on this section to see some of them. One day I hope to use the 3D Modeling experience in web,
                    software, and game development!
